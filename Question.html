While much is known about creativity, there is a lot I still questioned. First, I <br>
questioned whether creativity can be learned. We have learned that genes have been <br>
linked to creativity, specifically a gene called neuregulin 1. Neuregulin 1 is present<br>
 in many people with mental illness and relatives of those with mental illness <br>
 (Arehart-Trichel, 2012). This means that creativity can be genetic, and in that way, <br>
 certain individuals are more likely to be creative than others. After learning this, I <br>
 questioned whether creativity is mostly determined at birth, or if it can be learned by<br>
 individuals that do not have genes that predispose them to creativity. I would like to <br>
 see more studies on the impact of practicing creative thinking and if there are any ways <br>
 it can be learned and taught.

 <h3 class="writing1">
I also questioned if it is possible to definitively recognize creativity. While 
inventions like the Swiffer are deemed highly creative, I wonder if it is possible
 to say this is definitely so. While the Swiffer took imagination, divergent thinking,
 prior knowledge, and problem-solving to invent and resulted in a novel product, 
 I asked whether this involves creativity for certain or merely reflected the aspects
 to creative thinking. While it mirrored creativity, it could be possible that the 
 Swiffer was invented by seeing someone wipe the floor with paper towels and thinking
 to attach a stick. While the Swiffer and other inventions very likely required 
 creativity, I question whether we can ever know for sure.

<h3 class="writing2">
After completing this course, I no longer question if creativity can be learned. I am 
now certain that to a degree, creativity can be learned. I know this now after seeing 
the process that individuals go through to make a creative product. Ferran Adria stands
 out to me when it comes to this. Ferran Adria is an inventive, creative chef that makes
 delicious and novel dishes. However, he was not simply born with the ability to make 
 these. Adria goes through 50 different recipes before perfecting his dish, using trial 
 and error to understand what ingredients and textures work together. Adria closes his 
 restaurant for half of the year as well, giving himself space from work to think about 
 new possibilities for his cuisine. (Hart, 2014). Ferran Adria creates amazing, novel dishes,
 but not because something he was born with enables him to do so. Adria makes creative 
 products with space to think and trial and error. The same can be said in reference to 
 the Swiffer. The creators had no genetic advantage to make a creative product, but they 
 used the tools of observation and trial and error to make the Swiffer (Leher, 2012). In 
 addition, he allows space to think of new dishes, as he recognizes that creative products
 cannot be rushed by time. Adria’s creative process shows that making creative products could 
 be the result of a strategy rather than the work of genetics. <br> <br>
There are no exact guidelines for learning how to be creative, a few things stand out. First, 
using trial and error can help one be creative or make a creative product. This allows the individual
 to see what works and what does not while looking for the perfect ingenious solution. Second, 
 contemplation seems to be vital as well. To be creative, individuals must be willing to explore 
 all thoughts about the product and to dig deeper into better solutions. This may look like taking
 a break from the creative process for someone like Ferran Adria or watching hours of people clean 
 up messes like the creators of the Swiffer. <br> <br>
After assessing these to be the two main steps to creative thinking, I tried it out for myself. 
Over the course of a week, I challenged myself to try to find a creative way to deliver my final
 project. I used trial and error, thinking of different ideas and outlining what they would look 
 like to see if they would be both novel and effective. I also tried to think deeply and contemplate
 what would be the best deliverable for the project, taking time to meditate and ponder all options 
 while also taking time to rest my mind. After a week, the best idea that I had was to continue the 
 website I had made for my midterm. While this process did not lead me to a creative idea, I attribute 
 this to only using this process for a week. This may reflect Adria’s need to close his restaurant for
 half the year, because the most creative products cannot be rushed. Individuals who make creative products
 like Ferran Adria or the creators of the Swiffer must repeat this process for months, if not years because 
 they come up with the perfect idea. <br> <br>
Although I believe that creativity can be learned, I still believe that creativity can be enhanced by genetic
 or mental health factors. Some genes and mental illnesses allow individuals to think and process information 
 in a completely different way than most, as I addressed previously, so it is obvious that they will have an 
 advantage in creative thinking. My opinion on this remains the same. <br> <br>
Like I previously mentioned, I now believe that creativity can be recognized. There are two elements that are
 constant throughout all of the creative products we have discussed so far, they are novel and effective. It 
 is a given that something must be novel to be creative. Creativity at its core is creating something that is 
 new. That is the reason that Ferran Adria’s food, Kendirck Lamar’s music, and the swiffer are considered groundbreaking,
 because they broke the limits of what we thought food, music, and cleaning products could be. Second, I think
 that in assessing if something is creative, it needs to be effective. If something novel is creative, but it has 
 no use or is ineffective, it cannot be considered creative. To exemplify this, consider Ferran Adria. Adria is known
 for creating highly creative dishes that seem impossible to think of. He uses ingredients that are not typically 
 paid together in a creative way (Hart, 2014). However, if Adria’s dishes were not effective at satisfying the taster’s
 palate and did not actually taste good, he would not be receiving praise for his unique food combinations and techniques. 
 Adria would no longer be considered creative, and would likely be remarked as a bad chef. While I still believe it is 
 impossible to measure how creative something is, I now recognize that it can be recognized by assessing whether something 
 is novel and effective. While the scope of creativity is large, I no longer question how to assess if something is creative. 
 Over the course of this course, I have identified being novel and effective as the definitive qualifications for a product 
 or idea to be considered creative.
