<h1 class="title"> What I Thought I Knew About Creativity </h1>

<h3 class="writing">
From reading and researching so much about creativity, I always knew that the one definitive <br>
 thing about creativity is that it is utilized in all fields and exists everywhere. While <br>
 traditionally, creativity is usually seen in products like paintings, poems, and music, it<br>
 spans farther than this. As creativity is the use of imagination, background knowledge, <br>
 divergent thinking, problem-solving, and emotional expression to think of or create novel <br>
 ideas and products, it must be apparent in every field or the field would not evolve. For <br>
 example, creativity is needed just as much in construction to continuously find better ways<br>
 to build things, as art to create new compositions.  <br> </h3>
 <h3 class="writing1">
In Creativity Creep, Joshua Rothman exemplifies this by quoting a list of creative products: 
“books, dances, radio shows, art exhibitions, software programs, advertising campaigns, hardware
 innovations, music compositions, public policies (written or implemented), leadership positions, 
 invited lectures, and buildings designed” (Rothman, 2014). Although products like advertising 
 campaigns and public policies are not conventionally creative, without creativity in these domains 
 we would see the same marketing strategies and policies that we did in the past century, yet they 
 are ever-evolving. The span of domains that creativity is necessary for is endless and proven time
 and time again in history, from the formulation of the structure of DNA to Picasso’s creation of 
 Guernica, and will continue to be proven as all domains evolve (Weisburg 2010).

 <h1 class="change">  Have My Views Changed </h1>
 <h3 class="writing2">
I still agree that creativity is utilized in all domains and exists everywhere. I have seen 
this even more as we have finished the course. Creativity is typically seen as a product of 
painters or writers, but it expands further than this. My views have not wavered on this, as 
I have seen creativity in even more settings now, such as food, music, and social media. 
Without creativity in every domain, they would never evolve. Food, music, shows, books, 
and technology would be the same as they were hundreds of years ago if it were not for 
creativity to advance these domains. Instead, we see musical minds like Kendrick Lamar 
creating technical and sophisticated songs that fuse together different inspirations while 
sounding novel from all other music (Mason, 2017). Creativity is what allowed Kendrick Lamar
 to advance the genre of rap and is what allows artists of all domains to create novel ideas
 and new ways of making art.. Creativity has always been a part of all domains and must remain
 that way in order to see advances in any field.
