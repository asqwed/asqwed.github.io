While not proven, I believe that creativity is often enhanced by mental illness and <br>
cannot be measured. <br>
 &emsp; While there is varying research on the topic, I believe that mental illness<br>
 can increase creativity. As The Neuropsychiatry of Creativity points out, there is a high <br>
 prevalence of mental illness in individuals who are widely considered creative. I believe<br>
 this is because mental illness can invoke a different way of thinking, which is needed in<br>
 creativity. This can be represented by having a different mindset, looking at the world <br>
 through a different lens, and having different perceptions of the same thing, seen through <br>
 people with bipolar disorder seeing colors as more colorful and smells as more intense <br>
 (Hermann et. al., 2015). When individuals think the same, they are likely to come across <br>
 similar solutions. On the other hand, having a different mindset and way of coming across <br>
 ideas can result in new and novel products. Although having mental disorders has not been <br>
 proven to increase creativity, researchers are on the path to this. Hermann and colleagues <br>
 reference a cross-sectional study that looked at features of mental health in comparison to <br>
 creativity. The study found that suprathreshold psychiatric symptoms and temperament features <br>
 play a major role in creativity (Hermann et. al., 2015). While this is not a direct correlation <br>
 to mental illness, individuals with mental illness display these traits. <br>

 &emsp; In addition, I believe that creativity cannot be measured. Some tests claim to do this, one of the most known and widely used being Guilford’s tests<br>
 on creativity. This tests would include questions like “name all the white edible things you can in 3 minutes”, “list all the uses you can for a brick in 3 <br>
 minutes”, and “list the possible consequences of humans having 6 fingers in 5 minutes” (Weisberg, 2010). While this measures divergent thinking, like many <br>
 other tests for creativity it fails to measure all aspects that go into creativity. As mentioned, I define creativity as the use of imagination, background<br>
 knowledge, divergent thinking, problem-solving, and emotional expression to think of or create novel ideas and products. In this way, creativity tests do not<br>
 even scratch the surface of measuring everything that goes into creative thinking. Also, I believe these tests are useless because they use time limits to<br>
 measure creativity. Some of the most creative inventions have taken years to develop. For example, the Swiffer, a novel product took 3 years of observation <br>
 and creative thinking to invent (Lehrer, 2012). This does not mean the creators were not creative when developing the Swiffer but merely needed time to <br>
 gain background knowledge and a different perspective on cleaning to create this novel invention.
